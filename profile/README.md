# Liscirum Digital: Free. Private. Reliable.

Liscirum Digital provides open source tools for everyday use - for communication, education and every other part of life. 

At the same time, we want to give every user the ability to understand the software they are using. 
This is the only way to enable truly free and informed choices.
The power of large corporations must be broken in favour of a new system based on the principles of freedom, innovation and independence.

Liscirum Digital is part of the struggle to liberate the World Wide Web.
Of course, it takes more than open source tools to change such a system.
However, every project, every new user of free (as in freedom) software, every single piece of code advances liberty.

We want software to serve people, not people to serve software.  
Join our fight for a new era of the Internet.  
Join us in building a new system with freedom at its core.
